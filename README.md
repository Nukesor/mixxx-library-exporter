# Rust Project Boilerplate

This repository is a mini rust project that contains all important libraries and setup steps I find myself re-using all the time.

## Commandline

- `clap` for commandline interfaces.
- `pretty_env_logger` for logging.
- `dotenv` For configuration via environment.

## Code helper

- `strum` for better enums.
- `chrono` because there's always time involved.
- `serde` & `serde_derive` for serialization.

## Error handling

- `anyhow` for generic error handling.
- `thiserror` for custom errors.
- `better-panic` for nice stack traces.
