# Mixxx Library Exporter

The project aims to export the Mixxx Library into other formats.
The main motivation behind this, is to be able to use your Mixxx library with proprietary DJ Programs such as Pioneer's Rekordbox or Denon's Engine.

## Configuration

The configuration happens via a file at `$XDG_CONFIG/mixxx_library_exporter.yml`.
An example configuration can be found in the root of the repository.
